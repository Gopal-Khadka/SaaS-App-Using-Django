# SaaS With Django
This is project developed by "coding for entrepreneurs" about "SaaS app with Django web framework".


## Libraries
### Backend Libraries

- **Django** (>=5.0,<5.1)
  - A high-level Python web framework that promotes rapid development and clean, pragmatic design. It is the main framework used for building the backend of the application.

- **Gunicorn**
  - A Python WSGI HTTP server for UNIX, used to serve the Django application in production environments. It acts as an interface between the web server (e.g., Nginx) and the Django application, handling HTTP requests.

- **psycopg[binary]**
  - PostgreSQL database adapter for Python. It allows Django to interact with a PostgreSQL database, which is used as the project's primary database engine. The `binary` version includes compiled C libraries for improved performance.

- **dj-database-url**
  - A utility that simplifies database configuration by allowing the use of a database URL string. This is especially useful for deployment environments (e.g., Heroku) where the database URL is provided as an environment variable.

- **python-decouple**
  - Helps separate configuration settings from code by loading them from environment variables or a `.env` file. This is particularly important for sensitive data like database credentials or secret keys.

### External Integrations

- **Requests**
  - A simple HTTP library for making requests to external services or APIs. It is used for integrating with third-party services or fetching external data.

### Static Files and Deployment

- **WhiteNoise**
  - A package for serving static files (CSS, JavaScript, images) directly from Django in production. It simplifies static file handling and is ideal for environments where a traditional web server (e.g., Nginx) is not used.

### Frontend Design Libraries

- **Tailwind CSS**
  - A utility-first CSS framework that allows for rapid, customizable web design. Tailwind provides low-level utility classes to build custom, responsive user interfaces without needing to write custom CSS. It enables a flexible and modular approach to styling the front end.

- **Flowbite**
  - A UI component library built on top of Tailwind CSS. It provides a set of pre-designed, customizable components such as buttons, modals, and forms, to speed up frontend development. Flowbite enhances the Tailwind experience by offering ready-made UI elements while maintaining the flexibility to modify designs as needed.
